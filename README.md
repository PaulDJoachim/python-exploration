# Starting with Python

## Installation
I primarily use a windows system for coding so to install Python I went to the downloads section of Python.org and grabbed the executable file. I also made sure to add the Python extension for VSCode. 

## Hello World
Hello world is easy in python, the "print" function will display any message on the output device so the code is just:
`print('Hello World!')`

## Basic Syntax

I've worked with Python previously but it's been a while so I pulled out an old practice program I wrote to refresh my memory. "blackjack.py" is a simple blackjack game that lets the user bet money and play hands of blackjack against a computer dealer. I studied the work I had done and recalled some of the basic syntax for Python:

### Variables
In Python variables are declared simply by writing the name of the variable followed by the value. They don't need to be declared in advance and they don't require a pre-designated type. 

### Functions
Functions in Python are designated with the 'def' keyword followed by the name of the function and any comma-separated arguments in parenthesis. A colon designates the body of the code and indentation denotes the length.

### Loops
In Python, for loops and while loops are started with the "for" and while" keywords. The first line serves as the conditional statement and the subsequent indented lines will be the body of the loop. Multiple conditional code blocks can be designated with the "elif" keyword. The "break" and "return" keywords will end the loop.
